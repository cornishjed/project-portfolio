    "name": "Jed Powell",
    "bio": "Earned a bachelorâ€™s in science (BSc) degree in Computing at University of the West Of England (UWE) following eight years of working in the demanding environment of a cleanroom facility. While this work experience provided a base of transferable skills including a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and project management; an aptitude for problem solving and an interest in computer science motivated my transition to a new career path within computer programming. This enabled me to progress to work as a Software Engineer at Workbit, developing software solutions that contributed to our Learning Content Management System (LCMS) where educational knowledge and workplace experience was utilised and reinforced."
